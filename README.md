# Open Constructs Library

Welcome to the Open Constructs Library, an innovative solution designed to enhance cloud infrastructure deployment and management.
Our library aims to provide a comprehensive set of tools and constructs that streamline the process of using AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) for automation and deployment tasks.

## About The Project

The Open Constructs Library is an open-source initiative aimed at supporting and simplifying the development and management of cloud-native applications.
By leveraging the power of AWS CDK, our library offers developers a wide range of pre-built constructs that encapsulate best practices, reduce boilerplate code, and accelerate the development process.

### Features

- **Pre-built Constructs**: A wide variety of constructs for common cloud infrastructure patterns.
- **Best Practices Encapsulation**: Implements AWS best practices out of the box.
- **Customizability**: Easily extend and customize constructs to fit your specific requirements.
- **Community-driven**: Contributed to and used by a growing community of cloud professionals.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Open Constructs Library, you'll need to have Node.js and the AWS CDK installed on your machine (Other languages will follow very soon). Follow these steps to set up your project.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18.x or later)
- AWS CDK (version 2.120.0 or later)

### Installation

1. Install the library via npm:

```bash
npm install @open-constructs/aws-cdk
```

2. Import the constructs you need in your CDK stack:

```typescript
import { SomeConstruct } from '@open-constructs/aws-cdk';
```

3. Follow the library documentation to see how to use the constructs in your application.
